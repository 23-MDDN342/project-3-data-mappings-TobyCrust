## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 3: Data Mappings

This code maps the points of your face and uses it to display a snake mask over the tracked points of your face. Different variables are controlled by sliders that are then feed into machine learning code that reconises what amount the sliders need to be changed for each face. Every mask has overarching basic features that are the same, like nose and mouth, with variences between each face such hair colour and gender.
